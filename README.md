SIMON GAME PROJECT
https://dhruv1197.github.io/Simon-game/
The Simon game is an electronic device that tests and improves memory skills. It consists of a circular board with four colored buttons - red, green, blue, and yellow. The game sequence starts with a single button lighting up, accompanied by a corresponding sound. The player must then repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the correct order. 

The game progresses by adding one more step to the sequence each time the player successfully repeats it. For example, if the original sequence is red, green, blue, and the player correctly repeats it, the game will then add another step, making the new sequence red, green, blue, yellow. 

If the player makes a mistake and fails to repeat the correct sequence, the game ends, and their score is displayed. The objective of the game is to reach the highest level possible and achieve the highest score. 

The Simon game relies on the player's ability to remember and replicate the sequence correctly, challenging and improving their memory skills as they progress through the game.
